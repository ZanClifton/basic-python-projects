# Parking Vehicle Detector

A Python project using pair programming with [Gareth](https://github.com/gwdawson), we collaborated to create a program that would take a CSV file and filter out any bikes then calculate the average stay length of all cars. The program also prints how many times each car has visited.

Try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/parking-vehicle-detector?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/basic-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
