# OOP Coffee Machine

This refactor of [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/ZanClifton/basic-python-projects/tree/main/18-coffee-machine) uses Object Oriented Programming to achieve similar results to the previous project. It functions differently as I added extra detail in the first project that wasn't required to create a more user friendly experience (such as telling the user how much money they'd inserted). The files `coffee_maker.py`, `menu.py` and `money_machine.py` were provided for this project by App Brewery, to teach the concept of using classes, their properties and methods without necessarily knowing the specifics of the code.

Once again, there are two secret commands for the coffee machine; "Report" and "Off". Please feel free to give them a go.
