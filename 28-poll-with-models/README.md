This is a project which creates a database of polls using Python with ElephantSQL. Multiple users can have active polls at any time, and people can vote on any active polls.

Try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/poll?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/basic-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
